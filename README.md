# Speech-to-Text---Transcription-Glass
The Speech to text - Transcription Glass converts human speech to text to help people with hearing disability enabling them to **'view'** the conversations using Raspberry Pi 0 WH and Google API for speech to text conversion


**ABSTRACT:** People with hearing loss and deaf people communicate in many ways-sign language, lip reading, hearing aids, etc. However, methods such as hearing aids and cochlear implants can be very expensive to acquire. Meanwhile, signing and lip reading require eyes on the speaker. A Transcription glass with Speech-to-text conversion is the answer to provide a comfortable wearable assistive technology device for deaf, hard of hearing, elderly, and other people. It allows them to improve their comprehension of spoken communication using captions. The device uses Google API to transcribe speech in real-time, ideally for people who are have hearing disability or deaf. To start building the Transcription glasses, we reflect an image that brings new information to one’s field of view without blocking their real-world view.
